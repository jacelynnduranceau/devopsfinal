## main.py
#
## Simple (fat-finger) flask application.  The application acts as a "frontend"
#   for the exampleDB3.py sqlite3 database engine.  
# The container starts by immediately deleting any old versions of the 'pokeDB.db' SQL database.  If you want to persist
#  this DB then delete these two lines and change the 'createDB' function in exampleDB3.py
#  as appropriate - perhaps reading the DB in from disk first.
#
#    Once it has deleted the old DB, it starts the flask server & listens on 172.17.0.x:5000
# the server continues to spin in background waiting to receive requests from a browser.
#
# After starting the server, flask instantiates the Flask microframework class as 'app' 
# and then waits for flask server to route requests to it, (after the server has received a 
# request from the browser).
#
# This program imports another python module called 'exampleDB3.py' which contains the
# SQLite processing engine.  the python import statement 'import exampleDB3 as db'
# means that any time that we want to call a function in exampleDB3, we need to preface 
# that function call with 'db.'  for example instead of making a call to getPokemon(),
# we need to call db.getPokemon()
#
# This program uses flask to demonstrate how to
#   provide the appropriate URL 'route' from the user - what CRUD operation they
#   would like to perform.  For the sake of time, it only supports the following 
#   routes:
#   '/'      display/send back/render the index.html file (the main welcome page)
#   '/pokedex'  makes a call to exampleDB3.py getPokemon() function that returns a DB dump
#   '/catch'   makes a call to exampleDB3.py addPokemon() function to add an entry in the DB
#   '/save'  when user asks to catch a pokemon (i.e., we receive an /catch route, 'GET' request ),
#            we send them back an html form called 'catch.html' to fill in with the 
#            information.  When the user hits 'submit' on the browser, the form returns
#            to us as a 'POST' call from the browser (and is routed to our /save route)
#            this routine then picks apart what the user filled in and calls 'db.addPokemon'
#   '/delete_pokemon' deletes a pokemon from the database / pokedex
